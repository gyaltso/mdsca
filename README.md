# MDSCA (Model Driven Static Code Analyzer) - WIP

A static code analyzer developed using Model Driven Development. The analysis rules are configured using a DSL developed using Eclipse Xtext. The analyzer is integrated with the Eclipse build, which when run triggers the code analysis. The result is in the form of warnings in the code with appropriate message.
